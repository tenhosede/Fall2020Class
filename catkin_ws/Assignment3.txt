Process of completing assignment 3:

Ros installed, either a pre-installed image or install from source.
Install Rosdep
Create a catkin workspace
Catkin_make in the catkin workspace. This will create a src/ directory
in the src/ directory, download the code from the provided github. Return to the workspace directory
run rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y, which will install all packages and find any dependencies that your package may be missing

At this point, the roslaunch commands from the homework assignment should work

My issues mainly stemmed from a missing msg module from std_msgs. The code would execute but would crash when trying to import the msg module. I added the message_generation package and common_msgs package
 but the module was unfound in those packages.
